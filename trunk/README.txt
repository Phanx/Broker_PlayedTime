Description
-----------

Broker_PlayedTime is a DataBroker plugin to track your played time on
all of your characters.

The tooltip lists all of your characters, across both factions on all
servers. The current character is listed first for quick reference.
Character names are colored by class. It optionally displays faction
icons, class icons, and character levels.


Usage
-----

The options panel can be found in the Interface Options window, or by
right-clicking the plugin.

To remove a character, type "/bpt delete Charname". If you have more
than one character with the same name (eg. on different realms), you
must also specify the realm name: "/bpt delete Charname Realmname".
Finally, character and realm names must be correctly capitalized.


Localization
------------

Compatible with all locales.

Translated into English, Deutsch, and Español. If can provide
translations for another locale, send me a PM.
