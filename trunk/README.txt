## Description

Broker_PlayedTime is a DataBroker plugin to track your played time on

Character names are colored by class. It optionally displays faction
icons, class icons, and character levels.


## Usage

The options panel can be found in the Interface Options window, or by
right-clicking the plugin.

Translated into English. If you'd like to provide translations for
another locale, post a comment on the download page.
