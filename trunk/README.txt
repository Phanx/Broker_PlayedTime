Description
-----------

Broker_PlayedTime is a DataBroker plugin to keep track of your played
time on all of your characters.

your total played time. Character names are colored by class, and the
character you're currently playing is listed first for quick reference.

Right-click on the plugin to enable or disable the display of character
levels, class icons, and faction icons, or to remove a character from
the list.
